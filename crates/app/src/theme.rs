//! The theme.
//!
//! One theme, not two. guise reads its colours from an app-wide global at the
//! moment a component paints, not at the moment you build it — so there is no
//! way to scope a second theme to the canvas subtree without it leaking. Rather
//! than fight that, Tailor wears the project's theme: switch the project to
//! light and the editor goes light with it, which is also the most honest
//! preview a builder can give you.
//!
//! The chrome keeps its own graphite surface ramp on top, so the panels around
//! the canvas never read as part of the design inside it.
